# Repository structure
- `ansible/`: Ansible playbooks and roles to configure the homelab services and applications
- `terraform/`: Terraform configurations to create and manage the Proxmox VMs, networks, and storage
- `.proxmox/`: Documentation related to Proxmox VM templates and cloud-init setup and configuration

# Disaster Recovery - Bootstrap everything from scratch

## Prerequisites
- Proxmox server up and running

- Create the infrastrucutre (VMs, networks, storage) by following the instructions in the terraform disaster recovery readme [here](./terraform/README.md)

- SSH to the bastion vm using the ansible user, pull the homelab repository, and run the ansible playbook from there

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook ./playbooks/site.yml --ask-vault-pass
    ```

- Configure arr applications through UI (The configuration as code is not yet implemented)

## Troubleshooting
- If you have the error when clongin the repo:
```
fatal: could not create work tree dir 'homelab': Permission denied
```
First check cloud init status, 
```bash
sudo cloud-init status --long
```
if it is 'done' then simply run
Fix permission
